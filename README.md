# WordPress-React
WPR(WordPress-React) is a WordPress website with a React theme, all within a Docker container, or just a plain react application that is ready for deployment as a WordPress theme. 

We advice to only use the docker setup, in its current state, as a development build. 

## Building and running

### Docker
For the specifics of a docker stack with a wordpress and react container go to the [README](./Docker/README.md) file. 

### Plain React
For the plain react specifics go to the [README](./React/README.md) file.
